# Example Discord Bot with DSharpPlus
This is an example bot to help understand how you can show the status of more than one FiveM Server Status in rotation, these saves having to create a FiveM Discord Bot resource and this bot will always be online even when the FiveM server is down for any reason. You can then extend this to manage accounts or additional items with your FiveM server.

Edit the config file with your own Discord Bot Token and Guild ID, add any Channel IDs for Error and Message logging outputs.

In the servers, add your own FiveM Server IP and Port, these must be publicly facing to see the servers players and info endpoints.

After all that, you can edit the bot to your own liking.
